<h3>Axis Inclination</h3>
<p>
  It occurs when the axis of rotation of a planet is tilted relatively towards
  the plane of its revolution around a larger object, in other words, it is when
  a planet is tilted as it rotates around the Sun.
  <br /><br />
  The Earth is inclined about 23.5 degrees, this means that sometimes the
  northern hemisphere is inclined towards the Sun, and others, in the opposite
  direction.
  <br />
  The inclination of the planet is what gives rise to the seasons, if the earth
  did not have this inclination, we would not have seasons and day and night
  would have the same duration all year round.
  <br /><br />
  If the planets rotated with the same axis of inclination of the earth, they
  would have difficulties in terms of the seasons, since each one rotates at a
  speed that depends on its distance from the sun, that is, the further away
  they are from the sun the slower they rotate and vice versa.

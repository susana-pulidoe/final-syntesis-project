<h3>Oort Cloud</h3>
<p>
  In the most remote place of our Solar System, there is the Oort Cloud.
  <br />
  <br />
  Unlike many planets and stars, this cloud is a spherical shell that surrounds
  it completely.
  <br />
  Made of thousands or maybe millions of pieces of icy space bodies, it has a
  much larger extension than the planetary region of the solar system and is
  almost a year's light from the sun.
  <br />
  <br />
  It was first studied in 1950, the name of the cloud is due to the astronomer
  Jan Hendrik Oort, who began the investigation of this region of the Solar
  System that would later be known by its name.
  <br />
  <br />
  Initially, the elements that make up the cloud were part of the stars that
  surrounded the Sun.
  <br />
  When the planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago, they gave off pieces of
  space matter called planetesimal throughout the universe. These objects had
  very diverse destinies. While some were expelled from the Solar System, others
  remained inside, it can be said that the cloud is made up of the space matter
  resulting from this process.

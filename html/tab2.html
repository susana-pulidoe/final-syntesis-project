<h3>Gravity In The Planets</h3>
<p>
  <span class="subtitulo">- Gravity -</span>
  <br /><br />
  Gravity is what makes pieces of matter unite with each other, to form planets,
  moons and stars.
  <br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtituloColor">Gravity in the planets:</span>
  <br /><br />
  - Mercury: 3.7  m/s²<br />
  - Venus: 8.87  m/s²<br />
  - Earth: 9,807  m/s²<br />
  - Mars: 3,721  m/s²<br />
  - Jupiter: 24.79  m/s²<br />
  - Saturn: 10.44  m/s²<br />
  - Uranus: 8.87  m/s²<br />
  - Neptune: 11.15  m/s²<br />
  - Pluto, which is a dwarf planet, is 0.62  m/s²
  <br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtituloColor">Gravity on the moon:</span>
  <br /><br />
  The gravity of this is 1.62 m/s2, which is why an object or person on the moon
  would weigh 16.5% of its weight on earth.
  <br />
  Therefore, a person would be much lighter on the moon.

  <br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtituloColor">Gravity of the sun:</span>
  <br /><br />
  The gravity is 274 m/s2, it is more intense than the earth.
  <br />
  That means that on the surface of the Sun you would weigh 27.9 times what you
  weigh on Earth.

  But the force of gravity is not only responsible for the fall of the apple on
  a planet, it is also responsible for the planets rotating around the Sun
  attracting each other with a gravitational interaction.

  <!---  Explanation --->
  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtituloColor">Calculation of the gravity:</span>
  <br /><br />
  We have chosen Eris, this is a dwarf planet to which we calculate its gravity
  with the formula of universal gravitational law
  <br /><br />

  <br /><br />
  - We canceled F, d and m2 since what we want to find is gravity.<br /><br />

  - The formula would look like this g= G M/d2 M: Mass<br />

  $d$: Radio<br />

  $M$: 1.67•10 elevado a la menos 11 Kg<br />

  $d$: 1,163 Km (being in km you must pass meters)<br /><br />

  - It was passed to meters multiplying 1,163 Km by 1000, which resulted in
  1,163,000 m. After this, we will locate the operation accordingly.<br /><br />

  - From this we conclude that the gravitational constant of Eris is
  0.8235365442 m/s2o<br /><br />

  $$ g=G\frac{M}{d^2} $$ $$ g=6.67\times 10^{-11} \frac{\text{N}\cdot
  \text{m}}{\text{kg}^2}\cdot\frac{1.67\times10^{22}\text{ kg}}{(1167000\text{
  m})^2} $$ $$ g = 0.823 \text{ m}/\text{s}^2$$

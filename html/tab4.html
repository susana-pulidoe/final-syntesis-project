<h3>Kepler Laws</h3>
<p>
  Kepler's laws or laws of planetary motion are scientific laws that describe
  the movement of the planets around the Sun.
  <br />
  They are named after their creator, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler.
  <br />
  <br />
  Previously it was believed that the planets revolved around the earth until
  Copernicus with his heliocentric theory showed that they revolved around the
  sun.
  <br />
  The kepler theory allowed the improvement of this theory, the kepler theories
  are synthetic, that is, their function is to describe the planetary movement,
  whose characteristics are deduced thanks to mathematical calculations.
  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtitulo">- First law: Law of orbits -</span>
  <br /><br />
  This says that the planets revolve around the Sun describing an ellipse-shaped
  orbit.
  <br />
  The Sun is located in one of the foci of the ellipse.
  <br /><br />

  <br />
  An ellipse can be described as a flattened circle with two spotlights or fixed
  points.
  <br />
  The degree of flattening of a curve that is closed is called eccentricity,
  When the eccentricity is equal to 0, the curve forms a perfect circle, on the
  other hand, when the eccentricity is greater than 0, the sides of the curve
  are flattened forming an ellipse.
  <br /><br />
  Example:
  <br /><br />
  <img
    id="imagenKeplerEjem"
    src="imagenes/EjemploKepler1.jpg"
    width="450"
    height="250"
  />
  <br /><br />
  The formula:
  <br />
  $$ e=\frac{c}{a} $$
  <br />
  Where,
  <br />
  - it's eccentricity
  <br />
  - c is distance from the focus to the center
  <br />
  - a is the semi-major axle
  <br /><br />
  The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is 0.0167, this means that the ellipse
  that describes the Earth is almost circular.
  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtitulo">- Second law: Law of the areas -</span>
  <br /><br />
  In this it is established that the vector radius sweeps equivalent areas in
  the same time interval. (The vector radius is an imaginary line that connects
  a planet with the Sun, so its length varies depending on the distance between
  the two)
  <br /><br />
  There are two points on the path of a planet where celestial bodies reach
  their distances and limit speeds.
  <br /><br />
  1. The perihelion is the closest point of a planet to the Sun.
  <br />
  2. Aphelion is the farthest point between a planet and the Sun.
  <br /><br />

  <br /><br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtitulo">- Third law: Law of periods -</span>
  <br /><br />
  This allows you to compare the characteristics of the movement of the planets
  with each other.
  <br />
  (The comparison takes into account the orbital period and the radius of orbit
  of each planet. - The orbital period is the time it takes for a planet to
  completely turn the Sun)
  <br /><br />
  The formula:
  <br />
  $$ \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}= K $$
  <br />
  Where,
  <br />
  - T2 is the time or orbital period squared
  <br />
  - a3 is the radius or semi-major Axis of the orbit of the cube
  <br />
  - K is the constant
  <br /><br />
  Taking into account the orbital period (T) and the radius of orbit (a) to
  obtain the Kepler constant (K).
  <br />
  The orbital period is expressed in years, and the radius of orbit is expressed
  in astronomical units (u.a.). Let's look carefully at the value of K.

<h3>Solar System</h3>
<p>
  <span class="subtitulo">- What is it? -</span>
  <br /><br />
  The solar system is a planetary system.
  <br />
  A planetary system is made up of a star and the celestial bodies that revolve
  around it
  <br />
  In the case of our solar system, the star that shapes the entire planetary
  system is the Sun, which occupies more than 30 billion kilometers, in which,
  as we said, its eight planets and other celestial objects are located.
  <br /><br />
  The next most important objects of the solar system are the planets, which we
  can divide into two different classes. Thus, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
  are smaller planets, due to their position in the solar system known as
  interior and rocky planets. There are also Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
  which are outer planets, much larger and composed of gas.

  Apart from the planets, 5 of the so-called dwarf planets are also known in the
  solar system. Ceres, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,
  and Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris, located in the Kuiper belt.
  <br /><br />
  The solar system is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, a barred spiral-type
  galaxy that has a diameter of approximately 105,000 light-years between its
  most distant ends. It is located in the Orion or Local arm, which is part of
  the Sagittarius spiral arm.
  <br /><br /><br />
  <span class="subtituloColor">Jupiter's Moons</span>
  <br /><br />
  Jupiter's moons are the set of natural satellites that orbit this giant planet
  of the outer solar system.
  <br />
  So far, the existence of about 79 moons of Jupiter is known, which makes it
  the planet with the largest entourage in the solar system.
  <br /><br />
  The four largest moons are called the "Galilean satellites", since they were
  discovered in 1610 by the famous Galileo Galilei.
  <br /><br />
  The best known are Io, Europa and Calisto.
  <br />
  But the biggest one is Ganymede.

  Ranking, from the farthest to the closest
  <br /><br />
  1. Neptune - 4345.4 million kilometers.<br />
  2. Uranus - 2721.4 million kilometers.<br />
  3. Saturn - 1284.4 million kilometers. <br />
  4. Jupiter - 628.9 million kilometers.<br />
  5. Mercury - 91.7 million kilometers.<br />
  6. Mars - 78.3 million kilometers.<br />
  7. Venus - 42.4 million kilometers.<br />
  <br /><br /><br />
  Our Solar System is only light minutes away from earth
